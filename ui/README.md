# UI

Why is it written like this?

I want the value of componentised web development without a heavy framework. The UI is not so complicated that it requires html to change once written. The style does need to be slightly dynamic, which can be accomplished through simple traditional UI development.

I am experimenting with ways of writing simple, well-organised, performant web UI code. I think it is important for this project because people may wish to look at an entire project at once.
